## myFourierEpicycles - you give me an image I give you its epicycles.

This is the code for a website I'm creating myFourierEpicyles.com. The site allows users

- Upload an image and find the its fourier epicycles.
- Draw in an image and find its fourier epicycles.

![]()

This code allows users to upload any image (png, jpeg, svg, gif) and the fourier epicycles drawing is.

### Important notes

- For **best drawing** upload **svg** images with **closed** paths. This is the preferred method.
- I have had to alter the source code of almost every node dependecy, as such the node_modules folder is included in repository.

### How to install

- `git clone https://github.com/trozler/myFourierEpicycles.git`

### Understanding Fourier Transfrom

For anyone who is curious these resources are good starting places in understanding the fourier transform and the drawing of epicycles.
